The causes can be attributed to blood loss, decreased production of red blood cells, and increased breakdown of these cells. Anemia is also categorized based on the size of red blood cells into microcytic (small), macrocytic (large), or normocytic (normal sized) anemias. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type worldwide, particularly affecting children and women of reproductive age during pregnancy. Symptoms may vary from mild to severe depending on the progression of the condition, including tiredness, weakness, decreased concentration, and shortness of breath upon exertion. Diagnosis typically involves a complete blood count and additional tests like flow cytometry or stained blood smear examination.\n\n--- end answer ---",
